title: Environment Variables
description: "We all know the struggle if we install new software and want to execute it via the terminal, but the only thing we see is `command not found:`. Whenever we see this error, it is the moment we need environment variables, and today we want to take a closer look at how they work."

On my installation videos for [Flutter on Windows](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=T9LdScRVhv8) and [MacOS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GuzMsZQUYs)
I got loads of comments in which you were the audience asking me
that they get the error `command not found: flutter` and how they can solve this problem. That showed me that there is
still a lot of questions around system variables that we want to answer now.

## Environment Variables
Whenever you install software via a wizard usually in the background it sets everything up for you.
The Installation Wizard of [Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a very good example for that. You download the wizard, click
through the process and at the end if you open your terminal you can enter `git` and get something like this:

```
âžœ git
usage: git [--version] [--help] [-C <path>] [-c <name>=<value>]
           [--exec-path[=<path>]] [--html-path] [--man-path] [--info-path]
           [-p | --paginate | -P | --no-pager] [--no-replace-objects] [--bare]
           [--git-dir=<path>] [--work-tree=<path>] [--namespace=<name>]
           [--super-prefix=<path>] [--config-env=<name>=<envvar>]
           <command> [<args>]
```

If we take separate the words `environment` and `variable` it gets maybe a bit clearer. If you have already some experience
as a developer you will know the word `variable` and understand that it can contain any value that you would like.
The environment in the word stands for the OS that you are working on. In this article we mostly will take a look on
Windows and macOS, but they exist also for Linux. These environment variables allow you now to execute commands in your
terminal, PowerShell or Windows Explorer and the Environment will know what to do.

## System and User Environment Variables
Windows offers you in the system settings the "Environment Variables" in there you see the differentiation between
`system` and `user` variables. While the system variables will be accessible globally for every user the system variables
are only accessible for the current user.
